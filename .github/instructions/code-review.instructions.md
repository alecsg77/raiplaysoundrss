- Test coverage for routes, helpers, and middleware.

## Change Quality

- Consistent naming, structure, and adherence to TypeScript strictness.
- Documentation updated with behavioral changes.

## Process
- Require passing tests and basic build checks.
- Encourage suggestions that simplify control flow and improve readability.
- Verify no unnecessary dependencies or scope creep.
